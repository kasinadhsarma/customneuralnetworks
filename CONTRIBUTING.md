# Contributing to Custom Neural Networks

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Custom Neural Networks as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code follows the project's coding style.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Code Style Guidelines

- Use C++20 features when appropriate
- Follow modern C++ best practices
- Use OpenMP for parallelization when possible
- Comment complex algorithms and implementations
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add documentation for public APIs

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Include performance tests for optimizations
- Test with different compilers and platforms
Code coverage is tracked using Codecov, and detailed reports are available [here](https://codecov.io/gh/yourusername/customneuralnetworks). We aim for high coverage, so please ensure your contributions are well-tested.

## Documentation

- Update README.md with changes affecting usage
- Document new features in the appropriate section
- Keep code comments current and meaningful
- Update architecture diagrams when needed

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable
2. Update the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version
3. Your PR requires approval from at least one maintainer
4. PRs will be merged after approval and passing CI checks
